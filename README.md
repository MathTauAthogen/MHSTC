# MHSTC

The unofficial app for the MHS Tutoring Club, written in Flutter for cross-platform compatability.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

The websocket server is going to be handled by another github repo, soon to be posted here.

It will likely be in server-side JS, for simplicity and having use of the database.

EDIT:A second python file should be started [here](https://github.com/MathTauAthogen/MHSTCW) for this, because the database must be used but the first file is becoming overloaded. Change the app.yaml file to redirect traffic to the new file when necessary. Look up the Google App Engine Docs.

Additionally, see [here](http://www.websocket.org/echo.html) for more details about it.
